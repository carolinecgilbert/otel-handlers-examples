# OpenTelemetry Python Logging Handler Examples
This is a demo for the custom Python logging library handlers implemented for OpenTelemetry. Overall, the examples in this repository run a basic Flask application with Docker to demonstrate an example application that uses OpenTelemetry logging with Python logging libraries (other than the default logging library). These examples are scalable to other software systems that require the use of the Python logging libraries such as structlog and loguru.

Note: The examples in this repository are adapted from OpenTelemetry's [Getting Started Tutorial for Python](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/python/getting-started/) guide and OpenTelemetry's [example for logs](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-python/blob/main/docs/examples/logs/README.rst) code.

## Handlers
This repository consists of examples for the structlog handler and loguru handler located in the [opentelemetry-python-contrib repository handler's directory](https://github.com/carolinecgilbert/opentelemetry-python-contrib/tree/main/handlers). For more information on these handlers and their testing please see that repository.
